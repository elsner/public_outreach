DESCRIPTION

       A public outreach project in cosmology aimed at high school
       students at the age of about 15. It provides a first glimpse at
       the basic properties of the cosmic microwave background
       radiation (CMB) and what it can tell us about our Universe.

       The project consists of a LaTeX document (in German language)
       with brief explanations and problems, and a simple computer
       program that allows to easily explore fundamental properties of
       the CMB in a hands-on way.


INSTALLATION

       Prerequisites: - Healpy [1]
                      - CAMB [2]
                      - Jupyter/Python2 [3]

       Install the required software. Download a map of the cleaned
       CMB in fits format, e.g., the Smica map from the Planck legacy
       archive [4]. Optionally, for a faster analysis, downgrade the
       map to nside = 512 and deconvolve beam and pixel window
       functions.

       Execute the Jupyter notebook cmb.ipynb and adjust the variables
       'file_*' to reflect the location of CAMB executable, CAMB
       parameter file, and CMB map on your machine.
